# open-payment-gateway

Open payment gateway(OPG) is a self-hosted tool to help you receive your payments in crypto currencies without relying on any 3rd party crypto payment processors. Yayy, no processing fees anymore!

Right now we're supporting network's native currency transactions on all evm compatible blockchains, such as:Â  Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.
ERC20 token transfers will be available in the next releases.

OPG supports HD wallets, so no need to backup addresses periodically in order to protect your assets.
All of your addresses are recoverable using a master public key(xpub). NO NEED TO PUT YOUR PRIVATE KEYS ONLINE to create addresses.

This increase privacy, since even in case of having an uncontrolled access to your server, no one can move your funds to another address because there are no private keys saved in the server, tho they can monitor all of your addresses since you've saved the master public key in the server.

OPG does have a few built-in tools for managing your funds, for example calculating the total balance of all the addresses, signing transactions and moving funds to another address.
More tools will be available in the next releases.

## Hardware wallet support will be added in v0.8

Take a look at [[roadmap section]].

OPG was written to be used with minimum configuration.
OPG supports 3rd party web3 providers, so you don't necessarily need any self-hosted node to operate. This significantly reduces your costs for 2 main reasons:

1. Running a personal node may require a huge amount of CPU, RAM, and storage resources, hence it would increase your server costs.

2. Sometimes maintaining a personal node is a pain in the back, there are some days that the server crashes, you run out of storage, network is down, and all the other scenarios, and all of them require you to manually look into the problem and monitor the nodes all the time. Why don't we delegate this task to someone else, like a third party web3 provider for a cheap price or sometimes free?

It does not mean that you can't connect it to your own nodes.

The documentation is still being developed, so please be patient.

Contribution is welcomed from everyone
